A bunch of utilities I like to use

Depends on the following environment variables
  $BIN_HOME: Where these files are kept
  $DEV_HOME: Where I keep my development environment
  $DROPBOX_HOME: Where I keep my Dropbox

allgits   - Gives the status of all git repos in a directory
anrar     - Cleanly unrars many .rar files with the same password
codemod   - Fork of https://github.com/facebook/codemod, adds support for crawling with `git ls-files`
drop      - Move files to dropbox
dun       - Pop up a growl box. Used as in `sleep 1000; dun`
gn        - Shortcut for growl notifying in scripts
links     - Show all symlinks and what they resolve to
pdrop     - Move files to dropbox/public
pop       - Finds a single file by a substring of its name. Used as in vim `pop SomeFilesName` to open a file with a long path.
shorten   - Shortens a url at http://phay.es.
trimpath  - Removes extraneous elements from the $PATH
vig       - Opens files by name substrings. Like pop, but for vim.
